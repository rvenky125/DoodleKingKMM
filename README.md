## Doodle King KMM app for Android and iOS
This project is the implementation of how one can adopt the Kmp (Kotlin multiplatform) for building Android and ios apps.
I rebuilt Philipp Lackner's doodle king api for backend. I have used the **Compose Multiplatform** to build the
UI of both platforms. If you are new to Compose multiplatform please go through: https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/


## How to build the project
To build the project you need some basic understanding of how the KMP projects are built.
For that, you have look at: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-mobile-getting-started.html<br>

To build the project first you need to clone and run [Doodle king Ktor api](https://github.com/rvenky125/DoodleKingKtor)
<br>
<br>
After that find the file `local.properties` file in the root folder of the KMM project and add below key value pairs.
````text
BASE_URL = http://[IP_ADDRESS]:7000/
WEB_SOCKET_BASE_URL = ws://[IP_ADDRESS]:7000/
````
